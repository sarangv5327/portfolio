		<h4>Course: AP Computer Science Applications 2016 - 2017
		<h4>Partner: James Wang<h4>
    <h4>In this project, we were assigned to create a Chatbot using the Java language. My group decided to create a physics tutor and derivative calculator. How this Chatbot worked was that it would respond to certain keywords it recognized. The derivative calculator was also run when "derivCalc()" was typed. To ensure this was password protected, we worked on an encryption algorithm where the user would not be able to access the Chatbot without the password. Overall, this project gave me a great in-depth understanding of Strings and how to parse them.</h4>
