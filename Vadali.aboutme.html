    <p>Technology can take the world to a different level. Innovation is the only way to improve our current technology. An engineer is a person who innovates and hence changes the world. I want to be this person. My name is Sarang Vadali. I want to be a software engineer who can simplify complex problems and make a common person's life easy by automation which increases the productivity of the world. To achieve this goal, I have to first understand the main problems that our society faces today. I would like to attend a top engineering school to understand the technology and research which will put me into the right path to achieve this goal.</p>
	<p>Many teachers, parents, and peers consider me authoritative and reliable. If I am given a task, I will try to complete that task immediately and not procrastinate. Others like friends and family consider me as supportive and friendly. I try to cheer up everyone and leave a smile on their faces. Apart from school, I love to spend time working on robots. I am in the Dublin High Robotics Club where I work alongside a team to strive to solve each yearâ€™s challenge presented by VEX Robotics. If I am not at school or robotics, I am at the park playing basketball. I love the sport and it provides as a great stress buster for me.</p>
	<p> Personally, I love to make mistakes at this age. This is because I can learn from these failures and utilize them to ensure I do not repeat these in the future. For example, from taking difficult classes as a sophomore, such as AP Chemistry or AP Statistics, I learned how to tackle college-level classes and proper time management skills. I realized how without spending extra time preparing aside from homework would only make one successful in the class. From robotics, I learned proper teamwork skills and later proper team management skills when I became captain. With lessons learned such as these and from engineering classes such as Principles of Engineering, AP Computer Science, and Digital Electronics, I am looking forward for upcoming challenges in the future to learn from them. Thank you for your time. Please feel free to browse the other pages or contact me with any questions.</p>
