		<h4>This project was designed to challenge us by designing a "Hangman game" with our prior knowledge of Python. This was to be completed in a four day span with a class period each day to work on it. Since we had such minimal time, we had to work to come up with a simple game as well as some visual appeal using asci art. Our game's theme was NBA teams. How the game worked was that the user had to guess a letter and it show the censored secret with the user's guess and previous guesses. The user had 20 tries to guess the word before they lost. The only flaw we had was that we could not find out a way to stop the game once they got the secret. To compensate for this, we had to get rid of the rule of only one letter per guess. This was to let them state the whole guess. If their whole guess was equal to the secret, they would win. If their 20 tries ran out, they would lose. The major lesson I learned in this project was how to work with a partner diligently to achieve a short-term goal. We had to manage our time and plan out before we had executed. Overall, I think this project went well and given more time, it would have been better.</h4>
