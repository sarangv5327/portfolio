		<h4>The Entrepreneur Project is a project designed for students in all engineering classes in Dublin High School. This project was assigned to us get a sense of how to sell a useful product to companies and other venture capitalists. 
		Our task was to think of a problem that exists in the world and design a solution that addresses it with the most simplist yet effective product. We saw that students lack personalized tutors that work for them the best way. In addition, we acknowledged that student tutors, who are recommended by teachers, are more resourceful than adult tutors since student tutors will understand the exact concepts being taught and would not cover new material to the student. The solution to this problem was our product, Stutor. Stutor is a web-app where one can find the perfect tutor based on optimizations of the application such as class and level of experience. 
		There are 5 different types of tutors: Direct student tutors, Hangouts tutors, Text tutor, HUB tutor, and professional tutor.  In addition, Stutor is also for administators and an administrator can moderate plagirism on the website. The full explanations of each are found in our documentation linked below. In this project, I was the one who came up with the idea as well programmed the whole app. I also worked on the website but wasn't the head for it. From this project, I learned how to program in Android Studio and also to control a team. Naturally, throughout this project, we had conflicts because everyone's view of the application was different. I was the person who controlled my team and made a final decision.
		Through this project, some leadership qualities demonstrated were resolving problems, teamwork, and problem-solving techniques. Overall, I feel like we undertook this project sucessfully as we have been chosen to present our product in the Entrepreneur Showcase.<h4>
